Persistent innovator with a commanding technical depth, breadth of experience as a trader and strategist at hedge funds in Boston and New York, and an uncompromising commitment to getting results.

I have a background in math, physics, economics, and technology and have worked successfully at the tiniest startups, boutique firms with 10 employees, and large financial companies. My primary interest is creating fast, pleasant and easy to use technologies that deliver tangible value to those using them.

## Career Objective

I am looking for a role that will be technically challenging and engaging interpersonally, leveraging some of the skills I can bring to the table -- software design, C++, full-stack web development, etc. -- while affording stability, growth opportunities within the company, and the freedom to explore startup ideas in my spare time.

Computational/Experimental Neutrino Detection 
*Stanford, CA*
: Worked with Dr. Giorgio Gratta, Stanford University, as part of the Study of Acoustic Ultra-high energy Neutrino Detection (SAUND) project, a feasibility study on the use of ocean hydrophones to detect the acoustic signature of ultra-high energy neutrinos. 

Research Quark Mixing Models
*Raleigh, NC*
